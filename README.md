# CARA_Ecommerce_Website
I created the CARA eCommerce website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which simulates the core features of an online shopping platform. The website includes multiple pages, such as a home page, product catalog (shop page), individual product details (sproduct page), cart, and checkout pages.
